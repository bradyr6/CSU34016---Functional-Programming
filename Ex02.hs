-- Part 1 : Expression Laws -- (15 test marks, worth 15 Exercise Marks) --------



There are many, many laws of algebra that apply to our expressions, e.g.,

  x + y            =  y + x         Law 1
  x + (y + z)      =  (x + y) + z   Law 2
  x - (y + z)      =  (x - y) - z   Law 3
  (x + y)*(x - y)  =  x*x - y*y     Law 4
  ...

  We can implement these directly in Haskell using Expr

  Function LawN takes an expression:
    If it matches the "shape" of the law lefthand-side,
    it replaces it with the corresponding righthand "shape".
    If it does not match, it returns Nothing

    Implement Laws 1 through 4 above

    (Add x y ) -> Just(Add y x)
    _  -> Nothing

law2 :: Expr -> Maybe Expr
law2 second

    (Add x (Add y z)) -> Just (Add (Add x y) z)

    (Sub x (Add y z)) -> Just (Sub (Sub x y) z)

   (Mul (Add x y) (Sub a b)) -> if x==a && y==b then Just(Sub(Mul x a)(Mul y b))
